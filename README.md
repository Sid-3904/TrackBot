It is a mini - project as a part of our tinkering lab. It involves usage of threading in python taking feed from webcam based on pattern recognition.

Story behind Basing on our initial ideas, we had thought of making a Raspberry Pi Turret using open CV. With a 3-weeks work and zero progress, we were able to install open cv in raspberry module with minimal hopes of our project's success. Turned to Arduino and successfully completed the project. But it had remained unportable.

Problems:

Unsuccessful installation of CV in raspberry. // Single installation of open cv took us 5 - hours with continuous presence. Memory Expansion. // We came to know that it is due to shortage of memory and later we had expanded it. Slow data Transfer. // The camera module was not so up to the mark and there was a recognition and processing lag. Then we had shifted to Arduino and camera became webcam.

Physical Structure. // It was a break-through as it involved the safe assembling.
